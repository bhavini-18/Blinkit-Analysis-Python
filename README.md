# Blinkit-Analysis(using Python)
## Objective of Project
 It Analyze sales data to uncover insights on product performance, outlet characteristics, and customer preferences using Python.
 
## Dataset used
-<a href="https://github.com/bhavini-18/Blinkit-Analysis-Python/blob/main/blinkit_data.csv">Dataset</a>

## Tools Used
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Process
Data Loading: Importing the dataset using pandas.
Data Exploration: Inspecting sample records, data size, field information, and data types.
Data Cleaning: Handling inconsistencies and preparing data for analysis.

## KPI Requirements
- Total Sales by Fat Content
- Sales Distribution by Item Type
- Sales by Outlet Establishment Year
- Comparison of Sales by Outlet Size
- Fat Content vs Outlet in terms of Sales

##  Visualizations
Various bar charts and other plots are created to present insights visually, aiding in:
- Understanding product category performance
- Identifying sales trends across outlets
- Spotting patterns in customer preferences based on fat content and outlet size

## Project Insight
The Blinkit Analysis project provided several key insights into product and sales behavior. It showed that certain item types, like packaged foods and household items,
contributed more to total sales. Outlets with larger sizes and longer establishment history tended to perform better in terms of revenue.
Products labeled with "Low Fat" or "Regular" fat content were sold more frequently than others. Sales also varied by outlet size and item category,
helping identify what sells best and where. These findings can help the business focus on high-demand products and optimize inventory across various store sizes and locations.

## Conclusion
This analysis helped understand Blinkitâ€™s sales trends using data science tools in Python. It successfully identified which products and outlets contribute most to sales. 
The project emphasized the importance of product categorization, outlet performance, and consumer preferences. The visual charts made complex data easier to interpret,
supporting better business decisions. Overall, the project showed how data analysis can uncover patterns and help Blinkit improve its product offerings, store operations, and customer satisfaction.
